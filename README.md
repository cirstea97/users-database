# Description

Hello there!ðŸ‘‹ This is a React project in which I am using TypeScript.
In this project I made an API call in order to get the database of
users from the website "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users".
Using React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useParams) and React Routing I
have managed to create a simple website in which I am listing these
users with some basic information. Of course, if you want to find out
more about them you can always click the buttons that I've created so
that you can get into a new page in which I am listing even more
information about these random users. Thank you!
